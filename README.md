# IMDB-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

# Main Goal
As deep lover of movies since their very beginning, I want to understand which titles are considered the best from the critics while dividing for each historical time

## Data Source

The IMDB website helps us a lot in this regard and all the .csv used in this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/DataStrander/Spotify-Reccomendation-System/issues) legally at no cost
