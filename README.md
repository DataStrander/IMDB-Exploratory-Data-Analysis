# IMDB-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

# Main Goal
As deep lover of movies since their very beginning, I want to understand which titles are considered the best from the critics while dividing for each historical time

## Data Source

The IMDB website helps us a lot in this regard and all the .csv used in this analysis can be found [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) legally at no cost

From either your Terminal or Anaconda Prompt
```bash
pip install imdbpy
```
